# Login Form using PHP and MySql

## Everyday is a learning day !

A login form is an essential website feature requiring user authentication. It allows users to access their accounts by entering their username and password.

You all need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, and PHP in order to create this login form. This login form asks the user for their username and password, then verifies that the information is stored in the database. If the username and password are in the database, the login form indicates that the login was successful and takes you to the welcome page.
When the user attempts to log in with just one of those details, the login form will reject the login attempt and display an error message stating that certain fields are missing.

The technologies I've used :

- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- XAMPP Sever
- MySql
- Text Editor - Visual Studio Code

#### Thank You Guys & Good Luck!
